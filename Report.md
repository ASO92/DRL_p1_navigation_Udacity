# Banana Frenzy Agent

## Project's goal

In this project, **the goal is to train an agent to navigate a virtual world and collect as many yellow bananas as possible while avoiding blue bananas**


## 1. Environment details

The environment is based on [Unity ML-agents](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents)

Note: The project environment provided by Udacity is similar to, but not identical to the Banana Collector environment on the Unity ML-Agents GitHub page.

> The Unity Machine Learning Agents Toolkit (ML-Agents) is an open-source Unity plugin that enables games and simulations to serve as environments for training intelligent agents. Agents can be trained using reinforcement learning, imitation learning, neuroevolution, or other machine learning methods through a simple-to-use Python API.

A reward of +1 is provided for collecting a yellow banana, and a reward of -1 is provided for collecting a blue banana. Thus, the goal of the agent is to collect as many yellow bananas as possible while avoiding blue bananas.

The state space has 37 dimensions and contains the agent's velocity, along with ray-based perception of objects around the agent's forward direction.

Given this information, the agent has to learn how to best select actions. Four discrete actions are available, corresponding to:

- `0` - move forward.
- `1` - move backward.
- `2` - turn left.
- `3` - turn right.

The task is episodic, and **in order to solve the environment, the agent must get an average score of +13 over 100 consecutive episodes.**

## 2. Agent Implementation
Agents use a policy to decide which actions to take within an environment. The primary objective of the learning algorithm is to find an optimal policy&mdash;i.e., a policy that maximizes the reward for the agent. Since the effects of possible actions aren't known in advance, the optimal policy must be discovered by interacting with the environment and recording observations. Therefore, the agent "learns" the policy through a process of trial-and-error that iteratively maps various environment states to the actions that yield the highest reward. This type of algorithm is called **Q-Learning**.

As for constructing the Q-Learning algorithm, the general approach is to implement a handful of different components, then run a series of tests to determine which combination of components and which hyperparameters yield the best results.

In the following sections, we'll describe each component of the algorithm in detail.

### Deep Q-Networks

#### Q-Function
To discover an optimal policy, it is setup a Q-function. The Q-function calculates the expected reward `R` for all possible actions `A` in all possible states `S`.

We can then define our optimal policy `œÄ*` as the action that maximizes the Q-function for a given state across all possible states. The optimal Q-function `Q*(s,a)` maximizes the total expected reward for an agent starting in state `s` and choosing action `a`, then following the optimal policy for each subsequent state.

In order to discount returns at future time steps, the Q-function can be expanded to include the hyperparameter gamma `Œ≥`.

#### Epsilon Greedy Algorithm
One challenge with the Q-function above is choosing which action to take while the agent is still learning the optimal policy. Should the agent choose an action based on the Q-values observed thus far? Or, should the agent try a new action in hopes of earning a higher reward? This is known as the **exploration vs. exploitation dilemma**.

To address this, it has been implemented an **ùõÜ-greedy algorithm**. This algorithm allows the agent to systematically manage the exploration vs. exploitation trade-off. The agent "explores" by picking a random action with some probability epsilon `ùõú`. However, the agent continues to "exploit" its knowledge of the environment by choosing actions based on the policy with probability (1-ùõú).

Furthermore, the value of epsilon is purposely decayed over time, so that the agent favors exploration during its initial interactions with the environment, but increasingly favors exploitation as it gains more experience. The starting and ending values for epsilon, and the rate at which it decays are three hyperparameters that are later tuned during experimentation.

You can find the ùõÜ-greedy logic implemented as part of the `agent.act()` method [here](C:\Users\rovaa\github\DRL_p1_navigation_Udacity\agent.py#L65) in `agent.py` of the source code.
